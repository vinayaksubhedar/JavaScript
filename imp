About Git Course
Git is a version control system (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) that helps you control your source code. For example, you can easily go back to older states of your code or revert in case you mess up your code.

Using it, is totally optional! It's also not a tool that's related to JavaScript in any way - you can indeed use Git in ANY (programming) project.

Since it is optional and not directly related to JavaScript, I will not dive into Git in this course. Nonetheless, it's definitely a tool worth learning for every developer.

In case you are interested, this tutorial gets you started: https://academind.com/tutorials/git-the-basics

Besides local version control and code management, you can also push your projects and all your commits ("snapshots") to remote storages. The most prominent (free!) remote service is GitHub: http://github.com/
